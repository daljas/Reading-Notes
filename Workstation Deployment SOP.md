4. What does the author emphasize regarding the audience when writing SOPs, and why is it essential to consider them?

   Keep it simple

   SOPs must be portable.

   Consistency counts

   Itâ€™s about the audience.

5. Imagine you are a part of a multicultural team responsible for following an SOP. How would you address potential misunderstandings or differing interpretations of the procedure due to cultural differences? Propose strategies to foster effective cross-cultural communication.

   Using visual aids as well as Cross-Cultural Communication would be helpgul for cultural differences. I want them to ask question so i can adjust or explain what on the SOP.
